**Task 1: Data Flow from Zammad to Django Plans**

* Explanation: This task involves the transfer of user data from Zammad to Django plans.

**Task 2: Webhook Verification from Zammad**

* Explanation: Verify the authenticity and integrity of webhooks received from Zammad to ensure they haven't been tampered with.

**Task 3: Associating Zammad User IDs with Django Plans**

* Explanation: This task involves the association of user IDs received from Zammad with the corresponding Django plans.

**Task 4: Managing Invite Creation Process (13 Steps)**

* Explanation: This process manages the creation and acceptance of invites for the Family Plan feature within the Django application. It includes steps to check plan capacity, generate tokens, validate users, update plans, and handle user detachment. These steps are essential for ensuring the functionality and integrity of the Family Plan feature.

**Step 1: Start of Invite Creation**

* Explanation: The process begins with the intention to create an invite for the Family Plan.

**Step 2: Capacity Check**

* Explanation: The system checks if the Family Plan has reached its maximum capacity. If it has, an error is raised.

**Step 3: Handling Capacity Limit**

* Explanation: If the plan is full, the process stops with an error. Otherwise, it proceeds to create a new invite token using the Zammad API.

**Step 4: Token Generation**

* Explanation: The Zammad API attempts to generate a unique token for the invite. If token generation fails, an error is logged. If successful, a FamilyPlanInvite object is created with the token.

**Step 5: End of Invite Creation**

* Explanation: The invite creation process concludes successfully once the invite object is created.

**Step 6: Start of Invitation Acceptance**

* Explanation: This phase starts when a user tries to accept an invitation.

**Step 7: User Authentication Check**

* Explanation: It verifies whether the user accepting the invite is authenticated. If not, they are redirected to the login page.

**Step 8: Token Validity Check**

* Explanation: Checks if the invite token is valid. If expired, a message is shown. If valid, the invite is linked to the authenticated user, and the user's plan is updated.

**Step 9: Redirection Post-Acceptance**

* Explanation: After successful acceptance, the user is redirected to a relevant page.

**Step 10: Start of Detachment Process**

* Explanation: This process begins when detaching a user from the Family Plan.

**Step 11: Detachment Execution**

* Explanation: It locates the specific invite associated with the user and detaches the user from it.

**Step 12: Resetting Invite Status**

* Explanation: The invite's link to the user is removed, and it is marked as unused.

**Step 13: End of Detachment Process**

* Explanation: The process completes with the user successfully detached from the plan.

**Task 5: Configuring Family Plan Settings (3 Steps)**

* Explanation: These tasks involve configuring and managing settings for the Family Plan feature through the Django admin interface. Administrators can access and modify settings such as user limits to tailor the feature according to their needs.

**Step 1: Define a Model for Family Plan Settings**

* Explanation: Create a model to hold configurable settings for the Family Plan feature, such as user limits.

**Step 2: Register the Settings Model with Django Admin**

* Explanation: Make the Family Plan settings model accessible through the Django admin interface by registering it.

**Step 3: Access and Modify Settings via the Admin Dashboard**

* Explanation: Administrators can log in to the Django admin dashboard to easily access and modify Family Plan settings user limits and other invitation configuration.


*Note: Other than a few small settings in the Django admin dashboard, this is primarily a backend task. No frontend development is required.*
